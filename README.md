# CommunityGardenCompanion
This project aims to connect members of a community garden with gardening-relevant information and each other, as an online counterpart to the physical space they share. Community gardens are meant to be social and educational, but often an overreliance on in-person interactions limits the potential of new gardeners to get involved and grow their best gardens. 
The Community Garden Companion steps in by letting gardeners share requests, offers and tips through a dedicated message board. It also lets you book the gardening tools available on a selected date in advance, and features planting timetables and the daily weather to help plan both long and short term garden activities.
